## Challenge

Create a meme generation app using UIImagePickerController, UIAlertController, and Core Graphics. Memes are a simple format that shows a picture with one line of text overlaid at the top and another overlaid at the bottom.

Your app should:

* Prompt the user to import a photo from their photo library.
* Show an alert with a text field asking them to insert a line of text for the top of the meme.
* Show a second alert for the bottom of the meme.
* Render their image plus both pieces of text into one finished UIImage using Core Graphics.
* Let them share that result using UIActivityViewController.
* Both the top and bottom pieces of text should be optional; the user doesn’t need to provide them if they don’t want to.
